      "Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.\n",
      "2) Web Application\n",
      "An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.\n",
      "3) Enterprise Application\n",
      "An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.\n",
      "4) Mobile Application\n",
      "An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.\n",
      "Java Platforms / Editions\n",
      "There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:\n",
      "1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition)\n",
